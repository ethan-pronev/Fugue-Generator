A Node.js program that generates random 3-voice fugues for the piano. Based upon a customizable harmonic progression, the fugue is generated by combining semi-random sequences of notes in the key of the piece at that point in time.

The inspiration for this project comes from Dimitri Shostakovich's Fugue in A Major, a piece build completely around perfect harmony, in that only the notes of the current chord are used at any point in time.

Instructions:
- Install the midi-writer library:
```
npm install midi-writer-js
```
- Running index.js will create a MIDI (.mid) file as well as an MP3 file.
- Change different settings in index.js such as the harmonic progression or the tempo to get different pieces.
